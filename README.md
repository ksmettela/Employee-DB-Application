# Java-Based Employee Database System
This project demonstrates a simple employee database system implemented in Java, allowing users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records. The project uses Java as the programming language and utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts for data modeling and manipulation.

## Features
The employee database system includes the following features:

- Employee Management: Users can create, view, update, and delete employee records in the database. Employee records typically include basic information such as name, age, position, and salary.

- Search Functionality: Users can search for employees based on various criteria, such as employee ID, name, position, or salary.

- Persistence: Employee records are stored persistently in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, etc.) to ensure data durability and availability across sessions.

- Error Handling: The system incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to users in case of errors or invalid inputs.

## Getting Started
To use the employee database system, follow the steps below:

- Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

- Install the required dependencies, if any. For example, if the project uses a relational database, install and configure the corresponding database software on your local machine or on a remote server.

- Build and compile the Java project using a Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.) or a build automation tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle, etc.).

- Run the main class or entry point of the project to start the employee database system. The system should display the user interface or menu options for interacting with the database.

- Use the provided options to perform CRUD operations on employee records, search for employees, and manage the database.

## Usage
Once the employee database system is up and running, use the provided menu options or user interface to perform various operations, such as adding new employees, updating existing employee records, deleting employees, and searching for employees based on different criteria. The system should provide feedback on the success or failure of operations and display the results of search queries.

## Conclusion
This system can be used to manage employee records and perform CRUD operations in a convenient and efficient manner.
